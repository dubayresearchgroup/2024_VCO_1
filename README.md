This repo contains the numeric data and analysis scripts for the publication "2D capsid formation within an oscillatory energy landscape: orderly self-assembly depends on the interplay between a dynamic potential and intrinsic relaxation times."

The subdirectory 2D_VC contains analysis scripts, input files to perform MD simulations, and text files containing capsid yields for all simulations presented within the manuscript

The subdirectory 'LAMMPSsrc' contains modified source files for LAMMPS version 12Dec18, which are required to run the simulations performed in this work.
